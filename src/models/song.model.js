/**
 * Pre-delete middleware for the Song schema.
 *
 * This middleware is triggered before a song document is deleted using `deleteOne()`.
 * It ensures cascading deletion of related data to maintain referential integrity.
 *
 * This is achieved atomically using MongoDB transactions to ensure that all deletions
 * are either fully committed or fully rolled back to maintain data consistency.
 *
 * Specifically, it performs the following operations:
 * - Deletes all comments related to the song.
 * - Deletes all likes related to the song.
 * - Deletes all comment likes related to the song.
 * - Removes all entries of the song from users' watch history.
 *
 * **Transaction Flow:**
 * - A new session is started for the transaction.
 * - All delete operations are performed inside the session to ensure atomicity.
 * - If any operation fails, the transaction is aborted to roll back all changes.
 * - If all operations succeed, the transaction is committed.
 *
 * **Important:**
 * - Requires MongoDB replica set (even for single-node) to support transactions.
 * - Ensure you have Mongoose version â‰¥ 5.10 to use transaction support.
 *
 * @function
 * @name SONG_SCHEMA.pre("deleteOne")
 * @param {Function} next - Callback to pass control to the next middleware function.
 * @throws {Error} Throws an error if any operation fails during the transaction.
 * @example
 * // Usage in the Song model schema
 * songSchema.pre("deleteOne", { document: true, query: false }, async function(next) {
 *   // Middleware logic here
 * });
